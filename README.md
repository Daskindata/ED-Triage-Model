# ED Triage Model
Developing a model for an interactive triage data tool that predicts a patient’s triage category on presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) and can be used to update a patient’s triage category after each collection of vital observations. The data was a deidentified extract of 556,652 EMR records from four NSW hospital Emergency Departments over a 3-year period (2017 – 2019) contained 77 variables. This required a process of analysing the numerical data to identify outliers and missing data, transformation and feature creation where necessary, whilst preparing and cleaning unique text that included identifying and dealing with text outliers. Combining pre-processing of numerical and text data and selecting target variables for feature engineering brought about finalising the dataset, allowing the creation of new features to add to the transformation pipeline, at the same time the model development was created through a register to record model evaluation. Feeding this information through to application development, selecting the right tools for the models that were being developed.
